# Eth-miner-example
# For educational purposes, I can show you a basic example of mining a simple Proof of Work (PoW) cryptocurrency, but please be aware that this example is not for mining Ethereum itself.
# Remember, this example is only for educational purposes to understand the concept of mining and how Proof of Work functions. It does not mine Ethereum or any other real cryptocurrency.
# Mining cryptocurrencies like Ethereum in real-world scenarios involve joining mining pools, obtaining specialized hardware, and following the specific mining software and configurations for the chosen cryptocurrency. As mentioned earlier, due to Ethereum's transition to PoS, traditional mining is no longer feasible for Ethereum.
